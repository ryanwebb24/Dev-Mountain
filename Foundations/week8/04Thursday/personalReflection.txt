ive honestly learned a lot abou tthe tech sphere like general knowledge i alraedy knew a bunch of code related things but when it came to how we design code how we implement version control and other aspects that was all new.

The most difficult part was always having my camera on and being active. its much easier to have my camera off and to not talk or listen because im at home. but i made the choice to always have my camera on and to always participate and not look at my phone or have anything else open on my computer and it helped me learn so much better.

The way i learn is through my own application of the topics when im actually able to build my own code is when i really flourish 

Im just gonna continue doing that and always build new code and always building things that arent jsut following instructions its building my own things with no help

I enjoyed it for the most part it was hard when people werent always willing to talk or when we just hopped in a call and talked while we worked seperatley 

My favorite parts are when i was able to do the tests which is weird to say but i loved it. I also just enjoyed everyone there and how i became the remote mic check and would always say you. but honestlyi just really enjoyed it all and all the people i met.
