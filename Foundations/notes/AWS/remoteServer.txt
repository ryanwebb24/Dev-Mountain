Steps to setup a remote server through aws.
1. first start by navigating to the ec2 service. (can be done by searching for it in the search bar) that is where you will create the server
2. then navigate to vpc and find security groups in the left hand dashboard. then you should see create security group
3. name your security group, then go to inbound rules and add a rule and choose all trafic, source being ipv4, then create rules for ipv6 and my ip
4. then scroll down to the bottom and click create security group (make sure that the server and the security group is set up on the same server region)
5. then return to ec2 by searching. then click the orange button that says launch instance
6. name it then choose an operating system (perferibly ubuntu), do proceed without key pair and then select existing security group and choose the one you just created.
7. if you want to configure anything else you can but the server is ready to deploy 
8. then scroll to the bottom and click the yellow button that says launch instance and it will work.

now that you have the server running you need to connect the server to github by creating an ssh and connecting it. (can be found online)

then run following commands
in the terminal 
sudo apt update

sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install nodejs -y

sudo apt install npm -y

sudo npm i -g n

sudo n stable

sudo npm i -g npm

sudo npm i -g nodemon

sudo npm i -g pm2

nodejs -v

you will now have npm and node

then download your repo and you can run your server file and your server will be accessable to all people with the given aws ip address.
