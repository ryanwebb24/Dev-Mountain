---BASICS---
when designing your full-stack application it is important to start with the backend so you can know what information
your frontend needs to send and have
---NPM---
npm stands for node package manager. With npm you can install code from the web and ude it in your code
to set up a npm project you start by puttin gin the terminal npm init -y

---EXPRESS---
end points:
    these are where the http requests are recieved and then proccessed 
GET request:
    request: the request object will have a lot of things in it but the important ones will be params body and query
    response: .status sends the status code you give it ex:(404 (means page not found)) .send() sends the response
POST request:
    post has the same req and res but we will use them differently
    req.body will show the object that you get from the http request 
    with post requests we will need to make sure the data the front end has sent is valid data and then if its not valid 
    we need to send an error status code so the frontend knows that the data was wrong
delete request:
    can use a body object that can delete or could just use the route param as the thing that will get deleted

---MVC---
mvc stands for model view controller
this is a structure for making good backend design 
model is where the database and the object-oriented code to represent them
view is the html templates or js used to create the html
controller is the section where the backend handles the urls
