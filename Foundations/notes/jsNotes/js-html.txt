there are two ways to include javascript in your html files the inline way and the linking of a script.
the perfered way to do it is to link the script of your js file
ex: <script src="index.js"><script>

---DOM---
dom stands for document object model. When the browser sees the the html file it will create a copy and store it in the browser
the copy of that html is called the dom. so you can manipulate the dom to change what the browser shows.

---CODE EXAMPLES---
document.querySelector('id') will find the first item that is being queried and return it
document.querySelectorAll('id') will get all of the elements that match the id which is basically an array 
but technically it is called a Nodelist
document.createElement('p') will create a new element in the html
document.getElementById('id') will get the element to the specific id
when you have already found your Node element(the queryselected item) you can do:
    .innerHTML it will show what is in ther specified tag
    .remove() will remove the element from the DOM
    .textContent will get the text content of the element (very similar to innerHTML)
    .setattribute('type','value') can set certain attributes of an element
    .classList is an object where you can access all of the classes of a certain element
    .appendChild(element) will add a child element to the specified element
