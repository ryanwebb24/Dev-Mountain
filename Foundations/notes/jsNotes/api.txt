---API---
api stands for application programming interface
apis provide tons of information and capabilities to developers. You can interact with certain apis using http requests allowing you to talk to other things that the api has.
the api is basically the send and recieve of the server, it is the part of a server that everyone interacts with.

---REST---
rest stands for representational state transfer. 
it is a set of standards for apis, they are:
    > URL's are uniform and meaningful
    > client and server are independent of each other 
        this means they can be written in different languages
    > http(s) is the protocol
    > each request is independent
documentation is key when working with and making apis. there needs to be a list of available endpoints,
tells how to format requests, what you will get back as data.

---POSTMAN---
post man is a way to interact with apis it is basically a way to simulate a front end and see the data that the api will send
