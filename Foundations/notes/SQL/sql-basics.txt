---SQL BASICS---
> sql keywords are convetionally in all caps but are not case sensitive
> but the names of values in the table are case sensitive
> strings must use single quotes 
> dates are stored year month day
> when setting up a table you set up each row like so: name data_type extra rules
> CREATE TABLE name will create a table with a name you want
> DROP TABLE name deletes a table with a name you want
> INSERT INTO name (key) VALUES (value): this will allows you to insert a row of data into the table 
> SELECT value FROM name: this will allow you to select whatever data you want from a table (use * to select all)
> when using select you can add where to the end that will filter the data by the condition you give it
> example of a good id for a table is: id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
> it is also good to use creation time stamp ex: creation timestamp without time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT (current_timestamp AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'), 

---DATA TYPES---
> integer: whole numbers
> Decimal:
> Float: up to 15 decimals
> varchar(n): this allows you to set a certain amount that this string can be specified by n
> text: this is the string data type in sql 
> serial: integer data type that will automatically increment and be unique
> uuid: creates a uuid
>

---EXTRA RULES---
> PRIMARY KEY: cant be null has to be unique and tells developers that this is the unique identifier
> NOT NULL: means that this has to have data in it
> UNIQUE: this is like the primary key and but it is not the primary identifier it just has to have unique data
> DEFAULT: allows you to set the default data
