There are many different types of react hooks. 
React hooks are defined as simple javascript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.
Here are some of the nuilt in hooks:
  > useState - useState is used to be able to manage a piece of data that changes. you can either change the state or access it.
    when we use useState we have to destructure some of the things we will need using array destructuring
    ex: const [input, setInput] = useState(initValue) Here you see that we have input which is our state which we can access like any variable.
    then you see the setInput which is how you set the new state. it is a function the param that you pass in is the new value you want the state to be
  > useRef - useRef is used to reference a react element. it will return an object with the current element when called
  > useEffect -
  > useReducer -
